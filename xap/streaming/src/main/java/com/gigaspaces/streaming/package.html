Provides the classes necessary to create, manage and destroy streams in
GigaSpaces XAP 9.0+. 
<p>
The streaming package is built on top of the XAP document api to allow
runtime flexibility.  Streams can be defined, interacted with, and destroyed
at runtime.  Streams rely on the FIFO mechanism, and as such, are constrained
to a single partition.
